### What it does:

This mod is the best ghost/combat macro out there FOR FREE. 
It automatically kills ghosts for you granting you coins and combat xp.

### How to use it?

After you launched your game you can type /enderflames in chat 
and a GUI will open with the settings and a tutorial for begginers.

### Is this bannable?

This mod is banable in terms of breaking rules, BUT due to a ton of fail safes and such it is very unlickely that you will be banned.

### Features

- BLACKLIST: This is a list of igns and nicks that the script should look out for and avoid being in the same lobby as.
- AOTV RETURN: Rebuilt the entire aotv return code, will continue to try to make it to forge and wont start trying to tp until its 100% in forge.
- WEBHOOKS: Player detection (tells you who came near you and sends you their skycrypt), Famous person(detects a famous person in your lobby and notifies you) and so much more to be added.
- AUTO ITEMS: Auto orb, auto pigman, auto wand and auto tuba (all can be toggled in the config).
- PERFORMANCE BOOST: Stripped mod of threads, re coded lots of parts to make it less heavy on your cpu/gpu.
- MORE CONFIG: Around 6 more customization settings!
- BUG FIXES: You can now have chat open for it to continue working, no aotv detected will now double check since it was being stupid.
- AUTO PET: Automatically swaps to your best damage pet (it calculates the damage for each pet).
